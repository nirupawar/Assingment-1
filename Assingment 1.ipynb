    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "*,'hello', -87.8,-,/,+,6\n",
    "Answer: There are a total of 4 Operators and 3 Expressions,\n",
    "They are:\n",
    "Operators: *,-,/,+\n",
    "Expressions: 'hello', 87.8, 6\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Answer: A Variable is used to store of information, and a String is a type of information you would store in a Variable. A               String is a group of characters or a single character usually enclosed in Double quotes \" \" or single quotes ' '.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different Data Types ?\n",
    "Answer: Three fundamental Data types in python are int, float, complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)int data type: We can use int data type to represent whole numbers (integral values).\n",
    "  Example= Int: 2,34.\n",
    "2)float data type: We can use float data type to represent floating point values (decimal values).\n",
    "  Example= Float: 0.6, 25,60 .\n",
    "3)complex data type: Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j.\n",
    "  Example= Complex: 8j, 2-4j.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Answer: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be                   evaluated. If we ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.\n",
    "Example: 3*2+6/3 is an expression which evaluates to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "   expression and a statement?\n",
    "Answer: An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators.When we type an expression at the prompt, the                 interpreter evaluates it, which means that it finds the value of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 3*2+6/3 is an example of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.When we type a statement, the interpreter executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements donâ€™t have values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: variable declaration and assignment are statements because they do not return a value."

    "\n",
    "Answer: As per python,Variable names cannot begin with a number. The python rules for naming a variable are :-\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "2)Variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "3)Variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, & _ ).\n",
